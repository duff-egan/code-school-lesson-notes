<!-- ====================== -->
        <section>
            <h2>Section</h2>
            <p>The <strong>section</strong> element represents a generic document or application section - W3C specification.</p>
            <p>This is very similar to a <strong>div</strong> element. However a div has no semantic meaning, whereas the <strong>section</strong> element does. It's used for grouping together thematically related content.</p>
            <p>In his book, <em>HTML5 For Web Designers</em>, Jeremy Keith tells us "You might want to replace some of your div elements with section elements, but remember to always ask yourself, 'Is all of the content related?'"</p>
            <p>While all section elements don't necessarily have to contain a heading, most generally do.</p>
            <p>Prior to HTML5 we probably would have used a div with a class or id of "section:"</p>
            <pre>&lt;div class="section"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;The Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
            <p>In HTML5 though we can instead use the section element to wrap our markup which makes our document much more semantic:</p>
            <pre>&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;The Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
        </section>
            <h2>Header</h2>
            <p>A group of introductory or navigational aids - W3C specification.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's important to note that you can include more than one header on a page - it's not just limited to the top portion of your site.</li>
                <li>The header usually appears at the top of a document or section, but is defined by its <em>content</em> rather than its <em>position</em></li>
            </ul>
